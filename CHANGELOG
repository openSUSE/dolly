History:

V 0.64.2 23-MAR-2022 Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com> Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>
  improved Makefile
  add a doly.conf configuration file
  add a firewalld rule
  typo fixes
  bug fixes
 
V 0.64.0 22-MAR-2022 Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com>
  add systemd socket support to start dolly clients
  nodes on demand from a dolly server

V 0.63.6 13-OCT-2021 Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com>
  fix hostname resolution is not done in case of usage
  of an external configuration file (bsc#1191613)
  fix -Werror=format-security

V 0.63.5 07-OCT-2021 Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com>
  improve help usage information

V 0.63.4 11-SEP-2019 Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>
  fixed warnings for gcc 11

V 0.60 11-SEP-2019 Christian Goll <cgoll@suse.com>
  Added pure commandline feature, so that there is no need for
  a dolly configuration file. Also output to stdout is now possible.

V 0.59 09-APR-2019 Antoine Ginies <aginies@suse.com>
        Cleanup warning building
  Change default output in non verbose mode (get some stats)
  Add -b option to specify the TRANSFER_BLOCK_SIZE
  Add -u to specify the size of buffers for TCP sockets

V 0.58C 23-MAR-2005 David Mathog <mathog@caltech.edu>
       Changed TRANSFER_BLOCK_SIZE to T_B_SIZE and replaced all
       explicit 4096 with this define.  Similarly, replaced all
       4095 with T_B_SIZEM1.  This allows a test to see if increasing
       this from 4096 to 8192 speeds anything up.  Netpipe suggests
       it should.
       
       Added a flag -n = 'no sync'.  When dolly waits for sync
       on an 80 Mb file it can take twice as long for the transfer
       to finish.  When dolly exits the disk light does come on, so
       it appears that the data flushes to disk asynchronously anyway
       when sync() is omitted.  

 V 0.58 2-NOV-2004 David Mathog <mathog@caltech.edu>
        (plus some minor cleanups by Felix Rauch)
        Added changes to allow "/dev/stdin", "/dev/stdout" processing for
  input file and output file. "-" would have been used but
  that already has some other meanings in this program.
  This makes it easy to use dolly in a pipe
  like this:
  
  master:  tar cf - /tree_to_send | dolly -s -f config
  clients: dolly | tar xpf -
  
  In this mode compression should be disabled. That allows
  compression option to be used on each machines' pipe.
  
  Redirected messages which used to be to stdout to stderr.
  Also, since in some modes the main node knows the slave node
  names, but they don't, this information is put into the
  environment variable MYNODENAME and retrieved via
  getenv("MYNODENAME") in the program. If this succeeds the
  node will not even try gethostbyname(). For compatibility
  with other systems, dolly also checks the "HOST" environment
  variable.
  
  Default to TCP_NODELAY. Set large input/output buffers.
  Ignore errno EINTR on select on client. Option to suppress
  the warning (there can be a lot of them!).

V 0.57 8-MAY-2003 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
       Splitted infiles and outfiles are now possible.
 Parameter 'hyphennormal' treats '-' as normal character in hostnames.

V 0.56 15-JAN-2003 David Mathog <mathog@mendel.bio.caltech.edu>
       Added parameter -S. Acts like -s except it doesn't
       check the hostname. Handy when multiple interfaces
       are present.

V 0.55 25-JUL-2001 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Added parameter for timeout (-a) and version (-V).

V 0.54 30-MAY-2001 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Fixed a bug with config-files larger than 1448 bytes.
	
V 0.53 25-MAI-2001 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Allowed empty "dummy" parameter
   
V 0.52 25-MAI-2001 Christian Kurmann <kurmann@inf.ethz.ch>
        Integrated primary network hostname add to change primary device

V 0.51 21-MAR-2001 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Extended dummy-mode with time limit
  Integrated use of extra network interfaces
 
V 0.5  March-2001 Christian Kurmann <kurmann@inf.ethz.ch>
        Started extensions to dolly for switch-benchmark.

V 0.4  25-11-2000 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Started to include the possibility to write compressed outfiles.

V 0.3  01-FEB-2000 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Dolly now supports tree topologies with any number of fanouts.
  (Trees are usually slower, so this change won't speed up dolly.
  I just implemented it to proove that it's really slower.

V 0.2  02-JUL-1999 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Some improvements...

V 0.21 31-JAN-2000 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        Status information backflow, no longer a ring topology.

V 0.1  xy-MAR-1999 Felix Rauch <rauch@inf.ethz.ch>
        First version for benchmarks required. Presented results
  at Cluster Computing 99, Karlsruhe, Germany
